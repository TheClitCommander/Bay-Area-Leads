# Midcoast Leads System - Project Status

## ✅ CURRENTLY BUILT

### 1. **Data Collection Infrastructure**
- **Orchestration**: `run_pipeline.py` with error handling, logging, and summary reports.
- **Collector Class System**:
  - `BaseCollector`: HTTP, retry, rate limiting, shared utilities.
  - `BrunswickPDFCollector`: Tailored for municipal documents.
  - `SchoolDataCollector`: Pulls district performance and budget data.
- **PDF Processing**:
  - Table + text extraction, form/OCR handling.
  - Brunswick-specific format parsing.
- **Caching**:
  - JSON-based with expiration, compression, and cache hit/miss tracking.

### 2. **Integrated Data Sources**
- **Brunswick Property**:
  - Commitment Books (2024): Tax data, assessment history.
  - VGSI Cards: Full property specs + sales history.
  - GIS: Boundaries, zoning, overlays, spatial relationships.
- **Ownership/Tax Records**:
  - Payment history, delinquencies, deeds, transfers, exemptions.

### 3. **Data Storage**
- **Warehouse**: Relational schema for properties, buildings, ownership, land.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Modular jobs with transformation + incremental detection.

## ✅ CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL

- VGSI, Commitment Book, and GIS connectors work.
- Caching actively prevents redundant pulls.
- Accurate deduplication, address normalization, and entity resolution.
- Classification and zoning checkers working.
- Valuation + age distribution metrics operational.

## 🚨 BLOCKERS & ISSUES

### Critical
- ❌ **Syntax error in `pdf_processor.py`** (multi-page table extraction broken)

### Performance
- ❗GIS timeout on large polygons  
- ❗Memory overuse on >50-page PDFs  
- ❗DB write slowdown over 1,000 records

### Data Quality
- ⚠️ ~8% of properties have missing/incomplete data  
- ⚠️ Historical sales data (pre-2015) showing validation errors  
- ⚠️ Tax map vs. GIS boundary conflicts

## 🛠️ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 🔧 Technical Fixes
- [ ] Fix `pdf_processor.py` table extraction bug
- [ ] Add connection pooling to GIS data retrieval
- [ ] Reduce memory usage for large PDF parsing
- [ ] Add batch transaction logic to DB writes

### ✅ Feature Completion
- **Lead Generation**
  - [ ] Scoring algorithm (property characteristics + market factors)
  - [ ] Filtering by lead potential
  - [ ] Lead bundling
  - [ ] QA workflow
- **Auction System**
  - [ ] Real-time WebSocket bidding
  - [ ] Hybrid auction scheduling
  - [ ] Validation + notification
- **Payment**
  - [ ] 2-phase payment (auth + capture)
  - [ ] Deposit calculation logic
  - [ ] Refund mechanism
  - [ ] Payment audit/reconciliation

## ⚙️ FUTURE ROADMAP

### 🧠 Advanced Features
- **User Reputation**: Trust scores, tiered lead access, automated verification
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Market trends, ROI models, seasonal trends

### ✅ Testing + Validation
- [ ] Build test suite for all collectors
- [ ] Add validation checks for key data
- [ ] Load + stress testing for auction/performance scaling
- [ ] Create UAT (User Acceptance Testing) for auction UX

### 📘 Documentation
- [ ] Dev docs for all components
- [ ] User-facing manuals for lead buying/auction
- [ ] API docs for future partner integration
- [ ] Property attribute data dictionary

## 📅 TIMELINE

### 🟩 Phase 1 (Now)
- Critical bug fixes
- Finalize Brunswick data coverage
- Base scoring system online

### 🟨 Phase 2 (Next 2–4 weeks)
- Build auction + payment infrastructure
- Lead browsing UI
- First version of bidding live

### 🟦 Phase 3 (1–2 months)
- Reputation, dispute systems
- Advanced analytics rollout
- Expand to more municipalities

## 🚀 RESOURCES NEEDED

- 🧑‍💻 **1–2 Python devs** for core system and backend expansion
- 📊 **Data Scientist** for scoring algorithm + QA logic
- 💾 **Database Upgrade** to support full municipal datasets
- 💳 **Payment Processor** setup (e.g. Stripe, Plaid, etc.)
