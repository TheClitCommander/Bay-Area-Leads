# Brunswick Data Collection Capabilities Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the data collection capabilities available in the MidcoastLeads and BrunswickCollector projects, with a focus on identifying functional components, missing elements, and potential improvements.

## Projects Structure
The data collection functionality is spread across two related projects:

1. **MidcoastLeads** (`/Users/bendickinson/Desktop/MidcoastLeads`)
   - Main project with various collectors for property data, GIS, tax maps, etc.
   - Contains visualization and analysis components
   - Missing proper dependency setup (requires virtual environment)

2. **BrunswickCollector** (`/Users/bendickinson/CascadeProjects/BrunswickCollector`)
   - Focused on PDF data extraction for Brunswick municipal data
   - Contains enhanced collectors for PDF processing, particularly for school data
   - Has working dependency setup with virtual environment

## Functional Components

### PDF Data Extraction
The BrunswickCollector project has several working components:

1. **Municipal Valuation Certification Data** - Successfully extracts data from PDF
2. **SchoolDataCollector** - Has methods for:
   - School budget data extraction
   - School performance reports
   - Enrollment projections
   - (Note: While methods exist, they need proper URL configuration as they're returning 404 errors)

### Data Sources Available
Based on MEMORIES and code review, the system has collectors for:

1. **Property Data Sources**:
   - VGSI Property Database (basic property info, assessments, characteristics)
   - Commitment Book (tax obligation data)
   - Property Cards
   - GIS data (property geometries, flood zones, zoning)

2. **Municipal Data Sources**:
   - Personal Property Commitment Book
   - Municipal Valuation Return
   - Top Taxpayers data
   - Tax Bills

3. **School Data Sources**:
   - School Budget data
   - Performance Reports
   - Enrollment Projections

4. **Geographic Data**:
   - Tax Maps
   - GIS layers
   - Zoning information

## Issues Identified

1. **URL Configuration**:
   - Several PDF downloaders are experiencing 404 errors
   - Need to update URLs to match the latest documents on Brunswick's site

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - MidcoastLeads project needs proper dependency installation
   - Some Python packages causing installation issues (e.g., Pillow)

3. **Method Naming Inconsistencies**:
   - Some methods are referenced differently across code (`collect_commitment_book` vs `_parse_commitment_book`)

4. **PDF Parsing Errors**:
   - Some PDFs are not properly recognized ("No /Root object! - Is this really a PDF?")
   - EOF marker errors suggest potential download issues

## Working Components

1. **Municipal Valuation Certification Data Collection**:
   - Successfully extracts and saves data as JSON

2. **PDF Processing Utilities**:
   - Core PDF extraction functions are operational
   - Data structure and processing logic is in place

3. **Data Storage Framework**:
   - JSON file storage is working
   - Database interaction components are present but need testing

## Next Steps

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Create or update the virtual environment with all necessary dependencies
   - Document dependency installation process

2. **URL Updates**:
   - Review and update all data source URLs to match current Brunswick municipal site
   - Add error handling for 404s with fallback URLs or cached data

3. **Collector Integration**:
   - Bridge the functionality between MidcoastLeads and BrunswickCollector
   - Ensure consistent method naming and parameter passing

4. **Data Pipeline Enhancement**:
   - Update the data pipeline to handle errors gracefully
   - Add data validation steps
   - Implement logging for all collection processes

5. **Testing Plan**:
   - Create test cases for each collector
   - Develop mock data for testing without hitting external services
   - Document success criteria for each data source

## Conclusion
The Brunswick data collection system has a comprehensive set of collectors designed to extract data from various municipal sources. While some components are working correctly, others need configuration updates and error handling improvements. The core functionality for PDF extraction is operational, providing a good foundation for enhancements. With proper dependency management and URL updates, the system should be able to collect data from all identified sources.
